### Hello everyone! ðŸ‘‹

âœ¨ My name is Andrey, I am 12 years old, I study in the 7th grade, I like to write small programs in Delphi :) âœ¨ 
My main language is **Russian** , additional - **English** and **German** (how did he get me...)

### My site :D
https://kroshmorkovkin.ru/?source=github
(**so far, the site is not working**)

### âœ¨âœ¨âœ¨My favourite projects :) âœ¨âœ¨âœ¨

## [SA.CMS]https://github.com/kroshmorkovkin/sacms - my mini CMS, with template support, this is the first thing I did in PHP, and I think I'll study it further :-D
## [Krosh.Server Script 4 Ubuntu - new name KM:ServerInstaller]https://github.com/kroshmorkovkin/KroshServerScript-4-Ubuntu - I have been working with configuring web servers for a long time, and I decided, why don't I make a script for auto-installing server software? No one will give up the good old PHP5, a cool Apache, and a convenient MySQL database, right? :-) All this was written for bubunta (it's Ubuntu 18.02.4) and maybe it won't start on newer versions of ubuntu, and maybe it will :) Also, for the beauty, I added neofetch and screenfetch, it's necessary to look at the information about the server :-D
